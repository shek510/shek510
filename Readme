Shell script to collect the JFRs for the problematic embedded tomact applications to analyze the issue and debug the issue codebase.
This shell script creates 400 jfrs start from 1st and record the data for 15mins and start the 2nd file to write the data.
This script we created to capture the data for complete 4days of data and each file contains the data for 15mins so 24hours == 86400secs ==> 86400%900 ==> 96*4 ==> 384
There is a command to capture the JFR which we are used to capture the JFR file.
We given one second of sleep time after its capture the 900secs data and again start the new jfr file to capture the data.
We have to specifiy the PID (Parent ID)/ Process ID to in JFR Command to capture the specific application JFR.
Command is : jcmd 7 JFR.start duration=900s filename=/tmp/ProdJFR/JfrRecordingFile_messaging-pod-prod-gcp-6dbbc569f-4xxwc_gcpraomsapp05_$var.jfr
